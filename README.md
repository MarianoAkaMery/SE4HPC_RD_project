# 🌿 UrbanLeaf – Smart Urban Mobility Management

UrbanLeaf is a software system developed as part of the Software Engineering for HPC Master's course at Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2024/2025). The system addresses the challenges of urban traffic, environmental sustainability, and smart transportation through real-time data analysis and adaptive traffic control.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

UrbanLeaf is designed to:

- **Monitor urban traffic** using real-time sensor data.
- **Adapt traffic lights dynamically** to reduce congestion (Type 1).
- **Analyze historical data** to suggest traffic and public transport optimizations (Type 2).
- **React to planned public events** by proposing customized traffic and mobility plans (Type 3).
- **Inform and assist citizens** through real-time guidance via a mobile/web app.
- **Support managers** with review and approval workflows, logging, and reports.

## 🚦 System Features

### 🟢 Type 1 – Real-Time Optimization
- Detect congestion using sensor data.
- Dynamically adjust traffic light durations.
- Notify citizens of rerouting options.
- Log all automated decisions and generate daily reports.

### 🔁 Type 2 – Pattern-Based Optimization
- Analyze traffic trends from historical data.
- Recommend route changes and transport schedule updates.
- Generate yearly reports with suggestions and approval outcomes.

### 📅 Type 3 – Event-Based Planning
- Ingest structured event data from organizers and news feeds.
- Assess traffic impact of upcoming public events.
- Suggest temporary traffic and transport changes.
